The file summaries indicate that frontend/package.json and frontend/vite.config.js now exist with required dependencies and configurations. However, frontend/package-lock.json (REQ-9) is not mentioned in the diff, suggesting it may be missing or not tracked. All acceptance criteria for REQ-8 and REQ-10 appear to be addressed based on the summary descriptions, but REQ-9 implementation is unclear.",
