# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the empty frontend/package.json file and add all required dependencies to enable successful npm install for the Film Producer Platform React application.

**Planned changes:**
- Create complete frontend/package.json with React, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Router, TanStack Query, @dfinity packages, Tailwind CSS, and all necessary dependencies
- Generate frontend/package-lock.json with resolved dependency tree
- Ensure frontend/vite.config.ts exists with proper React, TypeScript, and Internet Computer configuration

**User-visible outcome:** Developers can run npm install in the frontend directory without errors and start the development server successfully.
